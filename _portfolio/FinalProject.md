Introduction and Background
=====
I am investigating and mapping the decline of agriculture and loss of farms in Maryland, specifically due to development.
According to Preservation Maryland, if recent trends continue, Maryland stands to lose 178,000 acres of farmland by 
2040 – a whopping 8% – and 67% of that conversion will occur on Maryland’s Nationally Significant land. That 
is the equivalent of losing 1,400 farms, $144 million in farm output, and 3,200 jobs. I believe this to be an
extremely important issue for several reasons that are social, economic, and environmental.  Having farms and 
agricultural businesses is an important aspect of community.  Being able to know where food is coming from and 
supporting your neighbors helps bond people to their local area and encourage them to invest in their community.  
Agriculture is also a major source of small business and independent contractors, granting opportunities to skilled
workers outside of major corporations.  Economically agricultural is an essential part of the U.S. and plays a role
in Maryland’s economy. Agriculture is the largest commercial industry in Maryland, employing some 350,000 people,
including nearly 6,000 full-time farmers, and contributing some $8.25 billion annually to the economy. Farms are
important for protecting the environment as well as helping to fight climate change. According to the 2017 annual
report of the Maryland Commission on Climate Change “land conservation and sustainable management offers an important
mechanism for mitigating and adapting to climate change [helping] to avoid or diminish additional GHG emissions which
would be associated with development”.   Areas designated for agriculture use are projected from development projects
which would otherwise clear vegetation and prevent soil infiltration.   Low density development such as suburban housing
developments are the greatest contributor to lost farmland and an unsustainable approach to human housing.
